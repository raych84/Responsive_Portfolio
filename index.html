            <p> "It was never easy for me. I was born a poor black child. I remember the
              days sitting on the porch with my family, singing and dancing, down in Mississippi."
              <br> -Navin R. Johnson
              <br>The Jerk
              <br>My name is Rachel Williams. I was born on Guam. I'm 36 years young. I've lived in Florida since
              1994. I
              graduated from
              Seminole High School in 2002. I attended Seminole Community College, now known as, Seminole State
              College,
              majoring in elementary education. After having some exposure to kindergarten aged children, I came to
              realize, that was not the best career choice for me.
              <br>I previously worked in customer service as an Employee Benefits Administrator. I left that job
              after
              nine
              years and started as a software QA analyst. The company that I worked for wanted all
              of their QA Analysts to learn automation, and I was bit by the coding bug. I decided to take this
              course
              so
              that I could learn how to write automated tests and eventually look into becoming an SDET.
