          <p class="card-text" style="font-size: medium;"> "It was never easy for me. I was born a poor black child. I remember the
            days sitting on the porch with my family, singing and dancing, down in Mississippi."
            <br> -Navin R. Johnson
            <br>The Jerk
            <br>My name is Rachel Williams. I was born on Guam. I'm 36 years young. I've lived in Florida since 1994. I
            graduated from
            Seminole High School in 2002. I attended Seminole Community College, now known as, Seminole State College,
            majoring in elementary education. After having some exposure to kindergarten aged children, I came to
            realize, that was not the best career choice for me.
          <br>I previously worked in customer service as a Employee Benefits Administrator. I left that job after nine
            years and started as a software QA analyst. The company that I worked for wanted all
            of their QA Analysts to learn automation, and I was bit by the coding bug. I decided to take this course so
            that I could learn how to write automated tests and eventually look into becoming an SDET.
