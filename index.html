        <p> My name is, Rachel Lauren Williams. "It was never easy for me. I was born a poor black child. I remember the
          days sitting on the porch with my family, singing and dancing, down in Mississippi."

        <p>Seriously, I was born on Guam. I'm 36 years young. I've lived in Florida since 1994. I graduated from
          Seminole High School in 2002. I previously worked in customer service as a Employee Benefits Administrator. I
          left that job after nine years and started as a software QA analyst. The company that I worked for wanted all
          of their QA Analysts to learn automation, and I was bit by the coding bug. I decided to take this course to
          that I could learn how to write automated tests and eventually look into becoming an SDET. </p>
